For connecting python3 with mysql database we need library PyMySQL is installed in computer machine.
To install the library we can type : pip3 install PyMySQL.
If there is problem related to access permission, try login as root then run "pip3 install PyMySQL" as root.
In python3 script we can simply import library with name pymysql instead of PyMySQL.
